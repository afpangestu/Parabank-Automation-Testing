## Introduction

Test automation is the process of using software tools and frameworks to automate test execution, compare actual outcomes to expected outcomes, and generate test reports. This helps to increase efficiency, accuracy, and repeatability of testing processes, as well as reducing the time and costs associated with manual testing. <br><br>In here we are going to test ParaBank (https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm). We are going to use tools and frameworks like Cucumber BDD (Behavior-driven development) with Selenium for the automation. This project focuses on automating tests for the ParaBank website using Cucumber BDD and Selenium.

## Scope

The project covers the following areas of the ParaBank website:

- Register page
- Login page

## Features

- Utilizes Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) to write tests in a human-readable format.
- Uses Selenium for interacting with web elements and performing automated actions.
- Organizes test scenarios using TestNG testing framework.
- Includes a wide range of test cases covering login, checkout product functionality, and more.
- Provides easy-to-understand bug reports and test outcomes.


## Tools and Technologies Used

This test automation project for  Labs utilizes a variety of tools and technologies to streamline the testing process and ensure efficient and accurate results.

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for writing the test automation code.

- **Selenium**: A popular open-source framework for automating web browser interactions and testing.
  
- **Gherkin**: A plain-text language that uses keywords to define test scenarios in a structured way, making them easy to read and understand.

- **JUnit 5**: A widely-used testing framework for Java applications, used to run and manage test cases.

- **ChromeDriver**: The WebDriver implementation for Google Chrome, enabling Selenium to automate Chrome browser actions.

- **Maven**: A build and dependency management tool that simplifies project setup and maintenance.

- **IntelliJ IDE**:  An integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java for developing computer software written in Java, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages.

- **Qase**:  A modern test management platform for manual & automated QA testing & reporting that helps your team deliver a higher quality product, faster.

These technologies are combined to create an effective testing framework that automates test cases, performs comparisons between expected and actual outcomes, and generates detailed test reports.


## Test Cases

The test cases are written in third-party platform using [Qase](https://qase.io/). Each test case covers various aspects of the ParaBank website, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

## Installation

Ensure that you have the following tools and technologies installed on your machine:

- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/)
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/)
- [Chrome driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org)
- [IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
  <br><br>Note: Make sure to download the relavent Chrome driver version for your chrome browser match, and put it into project directory.

## Usage

1. Open the project in IntelliJ or your preferred IDE.
2. Navigate to the `src/test/resources/features` directory.
3. Locate the test files with the `.feature` extension.
4. Run the test files using JUnit to execute the automated test scenarios.
